# DjentRiffBot
A program that generates a "djent riff" and posts it to its [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/DjentBot)

## Legend
* b = bend
* ^ = hammer-on or pull-off
* &lt;effect&gt;

Note: Until I can figure out a good way to represent frets of multiple digits (10 or higher), all frets are in the range of 0 - 9

Completely open to suggestions.

### What on Earth is this "Djent" nonsense?
"Djent" is a heavy metal subgenre characterized by use of down-tuned guitars of 8 or more strings. Or, just read the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djent) article.

### Why write this program?
Because I'm a free American.
